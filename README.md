Fortilogin
==========

This script can be used to connect a headless system to a Fortinet-based captive portal.

Fun fact : I decided to use this script to connect a Remarkable 2 device (e-ink tablet), which runs a fully-flegded Linux in the background to my school network that uses Fortigate for its infrastructure.

Forked from Palakis/fortilogin

Usage : fortilogin.py username [superduperpassword]

The password is optional. If you launch the script with only the username specified, it will ask for a password in a hidden prompt.
